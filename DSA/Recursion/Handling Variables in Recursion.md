1. **Parameters and Arguments:**
    - Pass variables as parameters to the recursive function. These parameters can represent the current state or information that the function needs to work with.
    - Modify the parameters as needed when making recursive calls to reflect changes in state.

2. **Base Case Handling:**
    - Ensure that the base case(s) of your recursion properly handle variables. Set the correct values or return values based on the base case's logic.

3. **Local Variables:**
    - Use local variables within each instance of the recursive function to store intermediate values.
    - These local variables should be independent for each instance of the function and won't interfere with each other.

4. **Global Variables (if necessary):**
    - In some cases, you might need to use global variables to maintain certain information across recursive calls.
    - Be cautious with global variables, as they can lead to unintended side effects and make the code harder to understand and maintain.

5. **Memoization (for optimization):**
    - When dealing with repetitive calculations in dynamic programming or other recursive scenarios, use memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant computations.

6. **Return Values:**
    - Ensure that your recursive function returns the appropriate value at each level of recursion.
    - When returning values from recursive calls, consider how they contribute to the final solution.

7. **Pass-by-Reference (where supported):**
    - In languages that support pass-by-reference, you can pass variables by reference to have changes propagate through recursive calls.
    - Be cautious with this approach to avoid unexpected behavior.

8. **Nested Functions or Helper Functions:**
    - Use nested functions or helper functions to encapsulate the recursive logic and manage variables without exposing them to the outer scope.
