## Heaps
A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, which can be of two types: min-heap or max-heap. Heaps are often used to implement priority queues and various algorithms like heap sort and graph algorithms.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Heap Property**:
   - A min-heap: In a min-heap, for any given node, the value of that node is less than or equal to the values of its children.
   - A max-heap: In a max-heap, for any given node, the value of that node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.

2. **Complete Binary Tree**:
   - Heaps are typically represented as complete binary trees. This means all levels of the tree are fully filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled left to right.

3. **Operations**:
   - Common heap operations include insertion (push), extraction (pop), and retrieval of the minimum (for min-heaps) or maximum (for max-heaps) element.

### Heap Implementation:

- **Array Representation**:
  - Heaps are often implemented using arrays. In this representation, each element is stored at a specific index, and the parent-child relationships are defined using index calculations.

### Common Algorithms:

1. **Heapify**:
   - Converting an array of elements into a heap (either min-heap or max-heap) is called heapify. It is used as a preprocessing step in various heap-based algorithms.

2. **Heap Sort**:
   - Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a max-heap to repeatedly extract the maximum element, resulting in a sorted array.

## Priority Queues

A priority queue is an abstract data type that allows for efficient retrieval of the highest (or lowest) priority element. Priority queues are often implemented using heaps but can also use other data structures.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Priority**:
   - Each element in a priority queue has an associated priority or key that determines its position in the queue. Higher priority elements are dequeued first in a max-priority queue, and lower priority elements are dequeued first in a min-priority queue.

2. **Operations**:
   - Common priority queue operations include insertion of an element with a priority (enqueue), removal of the element with the highest (or lowest) priority (dequeue), and peeking at the highest (or lowest) priority element without removing it.

3. **Applications**:
   - Priority queues are used in various applications such as task scheduling, Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path, and Huffman coding for data compression.

### Priority Queue Implementation:

- **Using Heaps**:
  - Heaps are a natural choice for implementing priority queues because they efficiently support both insertion and extraction of the highest (or lowest) priority element in O(log n) time.

- **Other Data Structures**:
  - Priority queues can also be implemented using other data structures like arrays, linked lists, or binary search trees. However, these may not be as efficient as heaps for certain operations.


## Classical Heap and Priority Queue Problems:

1. **Kth Smallest/Largest Element**:
   - Given an array or a stream of elements, find the Kth smallest or largest element efficiently using a min-heap or max-heap, respectively.

2. **Priority Queue Implementation**:
   - Implement a priority queue data structure using heaps and support operations like insertion, extraction, and peek.

3. **Heap Sort**:
   - Implement the heap sort algorithm, which involves building a max-heap or min-heap and repeatedly extracting the maximum (for max-heap) or minimum (for min-heap) element.

4. **Merge K Sorted Lists**:
   - Given K sorted linked lists, merge them into a single sorted list using a min-heap to efficiently select the next smallest element.

5. **Top K Frequent Elements**:
   - Given an array of elements, find the top K frequent elements using a combination of a frequency map and a min-heap.

6. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
   - Find the shortest path in a weighted graph from a source node to all other nodes using a min-priority queue (usually implemented as a min-heap).

7. **Prim's Algorithm**:
   - Find the minimum spanning tree in a weighted, connected graph using a min-priority queue (min-heap) to select edges with the lowest weight.

8. **Median Maintenance**:
   - Maintain the median of a data stream efficiently using two heaps, one max-heap for the lower half and one min-heap for the upper half of the elements.

## Patterns in Heap and Priority Queue Problems:

1. **Top K or Bottom K Elements**:
   - Many problems involve finding the top K or bottom K elements efficiently. Use a min-heap for top K elements and a max-heap for bottom K elements.

2. **Shortest/Minimum/Maximum Element**:
   - When you need to find the shortest, minimum, or maximum element in a collection, consider using a heap to maintain the element efficiently.

3. **Merging or Combining Sorted Structures**:
   - Problems that require merging or combining multiple sorted structures (lists, arrays, etc.) often benefit from using a heap to efficiently select the smallest element at each step.

4. **Graph Algorithms**:
   - Heap-based priority queues are essential in solving graph problems like Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths and Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.

5. **Maintaining Order**:
   - Heaps are useful for maintaining order in data streams, such as finding medians or keeping track of frequent elements.

6. **Efficient Sorting**:
   - Heap sort is a classic example of using a max-heap or min-heap for efficient sorting.

7. **Time Complexity Optimization**:
   - Heap-based data structures often lead to more efficient algorithms, especially when dealing with large datasets, as they offer O(log N) time complexity for insertions, extractions, and updates.

When tackling heap and priority queue problems, focus on identifying which elements need to be stored in the heap, the order (min-heap or max-heap) required, and how the heap operation fits into the broader algorithm. Heap and priority queue-based algorithms can provide substantial performance improvements in various scenarios.
