Scale-free networks are a type of network structure that exhibit a particular distribution of node degrees, which represents the number of connections each node has within the network. In a scale-free network, the distribution of node degrees follows a power law, meaning that there are a few nodes with a very high degree of connections (hubs), while most nodes have a relatively low number of connections.

#### Key characteristics of scale-free networks include:

1. **Power Law Distribution:** The degree distribution follows a power law, which means that the probability of a node having a certain number of connections decreases rapidly as the number of connections increases. In other words, a small number of nodes have a disproportionately large number of connections.
    
2. **[[Hubs]]:** Scale-free networks are characterized by the presence of hubs, which are nodes with an exceptionally high number of connections compared to other nodes in the network. Hubs play a critical role in maintaining the network's structure and connectivity.
    
3. **Resilience:** Scale-free networks tend to be more resilient to random node failures compared to networks with a more uniform degree distribution. However, they can be vulnerable to targeted attacks on hubs, as removing a hub can disrupt many connections.
    
4. **Real-World Examples:** Scale-free networks are observed in various real-world systems, including social networks, the World Wide Web, citation networks, and biological networks. These networks exhibit the "rich get richer" phenomenon, where nodes that already have many connections are more likely to attract new connections.

Power law distributions are often associated with social media networks and other complex systems, it's worth noting that the choice of distribution depends on the specific characteristics and behavior of the network in question.

**[[Power Law Distribution]]:**
- Power law distributions are used to describe networks where a small number of nodes (hubs) have a disproportionately large number of connections, while most nodes have relatively few connections.
- In the context of social media networks, power law distributions can reflect the presence of a small number of highly influential users (hubs) who accumulate a large number of followers, while the majority of users have fewer connections.


**[[Poisson Distribution]]:**
- Poisson distributions are often used for networks where connections are distributed more uniformly, and no single node has a significantly higher number of connections than others.
- In social media networks, a Poisson distribution could imply that each user has a roughly equal number of followers, and there are no highly influential users with a vastly larger number of followers.


### [[Triadic closure]]
Triadic closure is a fundamental concept in social network analysis that refers to the tendency for individuals within a social network to form new connections based on existing connections. It is a mechanism that contributes to the growth and structure of social networks.

When two individuals in a social network have a common connection (a friend, colleague, etc.), there is an increased likelihood that they will form a new connection between themselves. This phenomenon is known as triadic closure because it completes a triangle or triad within the network.
