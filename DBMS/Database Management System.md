It is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access those data.
The collection of data is usually referred to as the database.
The primary goal of DBMS is to provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is both convenient and efficient.

A DBMS is a database itself, along with all the software and functionality. It is used to perform different operations, like addition, access, update and deletion of data.

## Why not use File System?
- Data Redundancy and Inconsistency.
- Difficulty in accessing the data.
- Security problems.
- Data Isolation.

- Concurrent-access anomalies 
- Integrity problems
