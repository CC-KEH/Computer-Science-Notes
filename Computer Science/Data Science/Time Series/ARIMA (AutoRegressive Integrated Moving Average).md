## Introduction

ARIMA, which stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average, is a popular and powerful time series forecasting model. It combines autoregression (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) components to capture the temporal structure and patterns in time series data.

## Components of ARIMA

### 1. **AutoRegressive (AR) Component (p):**
   - The AR component represents the regression of the current observation on its previous values. The parameter \(p\) determines the number of lag observations to include in the model.

   - c is a constant, phi_i are the autoregressive coefficients, and epsilon_t is white noise.

### 2. **Integrated (I) Component (d):**
   - The I component represents differencing, indicating the number of times the raw observations are differenced to achieve stationarity. Differencing is performed to make the series stationary, reducing trends and seasonality.

   Difference(Y_t) = Y_t - Y_t-1

   - The parameter \(d\) determines the order of differencing.

### 3. **Moving Average (MA) Component (q):**
   - The MA component represents the regression of the current observation on the past white noise terms. The parameter \(q\) determines the number of lagged forecast errors to include in the model.

   - theta_i are the moving average coefficients.

## ARIMA Notation

The ARIMA model is denoted as ARIMA(p, d, q), where:
- \(p\) is the number of autoregressive terms,
- \(d\) is the order of differencing, and
- \(q\) is the number of moving average terms.

## Model Building Process

1. **Identification:**
   - Determine the order of differencing (\(d\)) needed to make the time series stationary.

2. **Estimation:**
   - Estimate the autoregressive (\(p\)) and moving average (\(q\)) parameters.

3. **Model Selection:**
   - Use criteria like Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to choose the best-fitting model.

4. **Validation:**
   - Validate the model using out-of-sample data.

## Applications

1. **Time Series Forecasting:**
   - ARIMA is widely used for forecasting in various domains such as finance, economics, and weather.

2. **Anomaly Detection:**
   - Detecting anomalies or unusual patterns in time series data.

3. **Econometrics:**
   - Modeling economic indicators and trends.

4. **Demand Forecasting:**
   - Predicting demand for products or services.

## Considerations

1. **Stationarity:**
   - Stationarity is crucial for ARIMA, and differencing should be applied as needed.

2. **Parameter Selection:**
   - Proper selection of \(p\), \(d\), and \(q\) is critical for model performance.

3. **Outliers:**
   - Outliers can impact the model, and pre-processing steps may be needed.
