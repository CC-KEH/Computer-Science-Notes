## Introduction

The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is a statistical test used to determine whether a time series is stationary or non-stationary. It extends the original Dickey-Fuller test by including additional lag terms to account for potential autocorrelation in the data.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Unit Root:**
   - The null hypothesis of the ADF test is that the time series has a unit root, which implies non-stationarity. The alternative hypothesis is stationarity.

### 2. **Autoregressive Model:**
   - The ADF test models the time series as an autoregressive process and tests for the presence of a unit root.

### 3. **Lag Terms:**
   - The ADF test includes lag terms in the model to account for autocorrelation. The number of lag terms is determined based on criteria like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).

### 4. **Test Statistic:**
   - The ADF test statistic is compared to critical values to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.

## Test Procedure

1. **Formulate Hypotheses:**
   - **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\)):** The time series has a unit root (non-stationary).
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\)):** The time series is stationary.

2. **Model Estimation:**
   - Estimate an autoregressive model with lag terms.

3. **Calculate Test Statistic:**
   - Compute the ADF test statistic.

4. **Compare to Critical Values:**
   - Compare the test statistic to critical values from tables or statistical software to make a decision.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - If the test statistic is less than the critical value, reject the null hypothesis in favor of stationarity.

## Interpretation

- **Rejecting the Null Hypothesis:**
   - If the test leads to rejection of the null hypothesis, it suggests evidence of stationarity in the time series.

- **Not Rejecting the Null Hypothesis:**
   - Failure to reject the null hypothesis implies that the time series may have a unit root and is non-stationary.

## Applications

1. **Economics:**
   - Testing the stationarity of economic time series like GDP or inflation rates.

2. **Finance:**
   - Assessing stationarity in financial time series such as stock prices.

3. **Climate Science:**
   - Analyzing stationarity in climate-related time series data.

4. **Signal Processing:**
   - Checking for stationarity in signal data.

## Considerations

- **Choice of Lag Terms:**
   - The number of lag terms should be selected carefully, often based on criteria like AIC.

- **Interpretation of Results:**
   - Understanding the implications of rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis is crucial for drawing meaningful conclusions.

- **Additional Testing:**
   - ADF test results are often used in conjunction with other statistical tests for a more comprehensive analysis.
