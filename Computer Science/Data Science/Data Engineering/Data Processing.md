Data processing refers to the manipulation and transformation of raw data into meaningful information. It involves a series of steps or operations performed on the data to convert it into a usable format for analysis, interpretation, or storage.

## Tools
Apache Spark and Apache Flink are both powerful distributed computing frameworks commonly used for big data processing and analytics.
