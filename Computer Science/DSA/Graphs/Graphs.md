1. **[[Graph Theory]]**
    - Introduction to Graph Theory:  Study of graphs to represent relationships between objects.

2. **[[Graph Basics]]**    
    - Graphs: Structures with nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them.
    - Types of Graphs: Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted.

3. **[[Graph Representation]]**    
    - Adjacency Matrix: Matrix showing connections between nodes.
    - Adjacency List: List of nodes and their adjacent nodes.
    - Incidence Matrix: Matrix showing edges and their connections.

4. **[[Graph Properties]]**
    - Degree of a Node: Number of edges connected to a node.
    - Path and Cycle: Sequence of nodes and edges.
    - Connected Graphs: All nodes reachable from any node.
    - Components: Subsets of nodes connected within.

5. **[[Graph Traversal]]**    
    - Breadth-First Search (BFS): Exploring neighbors before deeper levels.
    - Depth-First Search (DFS): Exploring as far as possible along each branch.

6. **[[Graph Algorithms]]**    
    - Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finding shortest paths in weighted graphs.
    - Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Handling negative weight edges in shortest path.
    - Kruskal's Algorithm: Finding minimum spanning tree.

7. **[[Graph Coloring and Matching]]**
    - Vertex Coloring: Assigning colors to prevent adjacent nodes from sharing the same color.
    - Edge Coloring: Assigning colors to prevent adjacent edges from sharing the same color.
    - Maximum Matching: Pairing the maximum number of edges without sharing nodes.

8. **[[Eulerian and Hamiltonian Graphs]]**    
    - Eulerian Graph: A graph with a single cycle that covers all edges.
    - Hamiltonian Graph: A graph with a cycle that covers all nodes.

9. **[[Planar Graphs]]**
    - Planar Graph: A graph that can be drawn on a plane without edges crossing.
    - Euler's Formula: Relating vertices, edges, and faces in a planar graph.

10. **[[Graph Isomorphism]]**    
    - Graph Isomorphism: Two graphs with the same structure but different node/edge labels.

11. **[[Applications of Graph Theory]]**
    - Social Networks: Analyzing relationships in online communities.
    - Transportation Networks: Modeling road, rail, or flight connections.
    - Computer Networks: Representing connections in communication systems.
    - Bioinformatics: Analyzing molecular structures and interactions.
