## 🧠 **Step 2: Setting Up Your First React App**

To write and run React code, we need a **development environment**. There are a few ways to set it up, but the best and most widely used tool is:

### 🛠️ **Create React App (CRA)**

A command-line tool that sets up everything you need to start building in React — in just one command.

### 📦 Prerequisites

Before installing React, make sure these are installed on your system:

|Tool|Purpose|Download Link|
|---|---|---|
|**Node.js**|JavaScript runtime for running code outside the browser|[https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)|
|**npm** (comes with Node.js)|Node Package Manager – manages libraries/packages|Included with Node|

To verify installation, run in terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

You should see version numbers like `v20.x.x` and `v10.x.x` or similar.

### 🧪 Step-by-Step: Create a React App Using CRA

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt**
2. **Navigate to the folder** where you want the project to live:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/folder
    ```
3. **Create your app** using CRA:
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app my-first-app
    ```
    - `npx` runs a package without installing it globally.
    - `my-first-app` is the folder/project name. You can name it anything you want.
4. **Navigate into your project:**
    ```bash
    cd my-first-app
    ```
5. **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    - This will open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.
    - You’ll see the default React page: “Edit `src/App.js` and save to reload.”

### 🗂️ What You’ll See in the Project Folder

|Folder/File|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`node_modules/`|Installed libraries/packages|
|`public/`|Static files (like index.html)|
|`src/`|Your actual React code (components, styles, etc.)|
|`App.js`|Main component that renders your UI|
|`index.js`|Entry point for the app – renders `App.js` to the DOM|
|`package.json`|Lists dependencies and scripts|

---

### 🧠 Quick Concept: How React Apps Run

- `index.html` has one `<div id="root"></div>`.
- `index.js` finds that div and renders your **`<App />` component** inside it.
- Everything you build in React is mounted in that single div — this is how **Single Page Applications (SPA)** work!

## 🧪 Practice Questions (Step 2)

1. What command do you use to create a new React app using Create React App?
	- `npx create-react-app <app_name>`
2. What is the purpose of the `npm start` command?
	- Starts the react app.
3. What does the `index.js` file do in a React app?
	- Finds the root element, and renders the App Component inside it.
4. What is the role of the `public/index.html` file?
	- Main entry point, creates the root element, inside which the entire app will be rendered.
5. Why does React only use a single HTML file for the whole application?
	- Because React creates a SPA, only components change, window has to remain as it is.
