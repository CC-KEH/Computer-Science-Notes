## 🧠 Step 1: **Introduction to React.js**

### 📘 What is React?

> **React** is a **JavaScript library** for building **user interfaces (UIs)**, especially for single-page applications where the user interacts dynamically with the page.

It was created by **Facebook** and is now maintained by **Meta** and a community of developers.

### 🧩 Why Use React?

1. **Component-Based Architecture**  
    React lets you build **encapsulated components** that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
2. **Declarative Syntax**  
    You describe _what_ you want your UI to look like, and React updates the DOM for you when your data changes.
3. **Virtual DOM**  
    React uses a **virtual representation** of the DOM to detect changes and update the real DOM efficiently.
4. **Reusability**  
    Components can be reused across different parts of an app or even in different projects.

### 🏛️ Think of React Like This (Analogy):

Imagine you're building with **Lego blocks**. Each **Lego piece** is a **component** — you can use and reuse them in various combinations to build different structures. React provides the tools to design, manage, and connect these Lego pieces to build entire buildings (apps).

### 📋 Core Concepts in React (Preview Only – We’ll learn each in-depth later):

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|JSX|JavaScript + XML – allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript|
|Components|Building blocks of a React UI|
|Props|Input data passed to components|
|State|Internal data storage within components|
|Hooks|Functions that let you "hook into" React features (like state, lifecycle)|
|Virtual DOM|A lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM|
|React Router|Enables navigation between pages in a React app|

### ✅ Real-World Examples of Apps Built with React:

- **Facebook**
- **Instagram**
- **Airbnb**
- **Netflix**
- **Uber Eats**

## 📚 Summary (University-Style Notes)

> - React is a **JavaScript library** for building dynamic and fast user interfaces.
> - It uses a **component-based architecture** for modular and reusable code.
> - React promotes a **declarative style**, allowing developers to describe _what_ they want, not _how_.
> - Key features include **JSX**, **components**, **state/props**, **hooks**, and the **virtual DOM**.
> - Created by Facebook, React is now used by many top tech companies globally.

## 🧪 Practice Questions

Answer these before moving on:

1. What is React and who created it?
	- React was created by ==Jordan Walke==, a software engineer at Meta (formerly Facebook). He initially developed it as a prototype called "FaxJS" to address the complexities of managing Facebook's Ads. React was later released to the public in 2013.
2. What are 2 key advantages of using React in web development?
	- Reusable Components, Efficient Performance with Virtual DOM.
3. Explain in your own words what a **component** is in React.
	- Small or Big Building blocks, that when come together, makes a website.
4. What is the difference between the **Virtual DOM** and the **real DOM**?
	- Virtual DOM: A lightweight, in-memory representation of the Real DOM
	- Real DOM: Actual Structure of a Webpage, rendered by browser.
5. Describe the purpose of **JSX** in React (just what you understand so far).
	- To extend JavaScript syntax and enable writing HTML-like code within JavaScript files
