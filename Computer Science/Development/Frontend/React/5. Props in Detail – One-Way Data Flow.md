### 📘 What are Props?

> **Props** (short for **properties**) are **read-only inputs** passed from a parent component to a child component.  
> They are like **function parameters**, allowing you to make components **dynamic and configurable**.

---

### 📦 Why Use Props?

- To **customize** components (e.g., `<Greeting name="Alice" />`)
    
- To **pass data** from a parent to a child component
    
- To keep components **modular and reusable**


---

### 🛠️ Example: Passing and Using Props

#### Step 1: Create a Child Component

```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

#### Step 2: Use It Inside a Parent Component

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting name="Alice" />
      <Greeting name="Bob" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

✔️ Output:

```
Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!
```

### 🧠 Props are Read-Only

You **cannot change props** inside a child component. They are **immutable**.

❌ This is wrong:

```jsx
props.name = "Chris"; // Error: Cannot assign to read-only property
```

---

### 🧪 Destructuring Props (Cleaner Syntax)

Instead of writing `props.name`, you can **destructure** props:

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

Same output, cleaner code.

### 🎯 Passing Other Types as Props

You can pass more than just strings:

```jsx
function Profile({ name, age, hobbies }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{name}, {age}</h2>
      <ul>
        {hobbies.map((hobby, i) => (
          <li key={i}>{hobby}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Profile 
      name="Alice" 
      age={30} 
      hobbies={["Reading", "Gaming", "Hiking"]} 
    />
  );
}
```

---

### 🔗 Props Flow One Way: Parent ➡️ Child

React has a **unidirectional data flow**:

```txt
App (parent)
  └── Greeting (child)
```

The child **receives** props but cannot **send data back** to the parent unless the parent passes down a function (we’ll cover that with events later).

---

## 🧠 Summary Notes

> - Props are **inputs** passed from **parent to child components**.
>     
> - Props are **read-only** and **cannot be modified** inside the child.
>     
> - You can pass any type of data: strings, numbers, arrays, objects, or functions.
>     
> - Use **destructuring** for cleaner code.
>     
> - Data in React flows **one way**: from parent to child.

## 🧪 Practice Questions (Step 5)

1. What are props in React? How are they similar to function parameters?
    - Props, i.e. properties, are read only input sent from parents to children. 
2. Can a child component modify the props it receives? Why or why not?
    - No, it is read only.
3. Write a `UserCard` component that takes 3 props: `username`, `email`, and `age`, and displays them.
    - `export default function UserCard({username, email, age}) {}`
4. How would you pass an array (like `["A", "B", "C"]`) as a prop and display each item in a list?
    - `{arr.map((element, i) => ( <li key={i}>{element}</li> ))}`
5. Rewrite this component using **destructuring**:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Welcome, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

```jsx
function Welcome({name}) {
  return <h1>Welcome, {name}!</h1>;
}
```
