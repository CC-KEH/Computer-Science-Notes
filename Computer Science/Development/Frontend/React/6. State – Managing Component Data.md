### 📘 What is State?

> **State** is a **built-in object** in React that lets components **store and manage dynamic data** — data that can **change over time** due to user interaction, API calls, timers, etc.

Unlike **props** (which are read-only and passed down), **state is local** and can be updated.

---

### 🧠 Analogy

Think of **props** as the **settings** you pass into a machine.  
But **state** is like the **internal memory** of that machine — it keeps track of what's happening **inside**.

### 🧪 Example: Basic useState Hook

React provides a **hook** called `useState()` to create and manage state in **functional components**.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times.</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

### 🧠 What’s Happening Here?

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

- `count` is the **current value** of the state.
    
- `setCount` is the **function** used to update it.
    
- `useState(0)` sets the **initial value** to 0.

Whenever you call `setCount()`, React **re-renders** the component with the **new value**.

---

### ⚠️ Important Rules of State

1. **You must call `useState` at the top level** of your function (not inside loops or conditions).
    
2. **State updates are asynchronous** — React may batch multiple updates.
    
3. **You should never mutate state directly!** Always use the setter function.

❌ Wrong:

```js
count = count + 1; // Don't do this!
```

✅ Right:

```js
setCount(count + 1);
```

---

### 🔄 You Can Have Multiple State Variables

```jsx
const [name, setName] = useState("Alice");
const [age, setAge] = useState(25);
```

Each call to `useState` manages its own piece of state.

### 🧠 Summary Notes

> - **State** lets components keep track of data that **changes over time**.
>     
> - Use the `useState` hook: `const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue)`
>     
> - Updating state causes a **re-render**.
>     
> - Always use the **setter function** to update state.
>     
> - Props = external inputs, State = internal data.

### 🧪 Mini Project Example: Toggle Button

```jsx
function Toggle() {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setIsOn(!isOn)}>
      {isOn ? "ON" : "OFF"}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Clicking the button flips its state between ON and OFF.

## 🧪 Practice Questions (Step 6)

1. What is the main difference between state and props?
    - state can be modified, props can't. 
2. How do you declare and update state in a functional component?
    - `const [count, setCount] = useState();
3. What happens to a component when you update its state?
    - it gets re-rendered.
4. Write a `LikeButton` component that shows a number and increases it each time the button is clicked.
```jsx
import {useState} from "React";

export default function LikeButton(){
	const [like, setLike] = useState(0);
	<button onClick={()=>setLike(like+1)} >
		Like Count: {like}
	</button>
}
```
