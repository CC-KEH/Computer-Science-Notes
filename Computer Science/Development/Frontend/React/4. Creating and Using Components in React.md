### 📘 What is a Component?

> A **component** is a **reusable, self-contained piece of UI** in a React application.  
> It’s like a **JavaScript function** that returns **JSX**.

In React, **everything is a component** — buttons, forms, pages, navbars — all built by composing smaller components together.

### 🧱 Types of Components

There are **2 main types** of components:

|Type|Description|Syntax|
|---|---|---|
|**Functional Components** ✅|Most commonly used today|`function MyComponent() {}`|
|Class Components 🚫 (older)|Still work, but not recommended in new apps|`class MyComponent extends React.Component {}`|

We’ll focus **only on functional components**, which are modern, cleaner, and easier to work with using **Hooks** (coming soon).

### 🛠️ Creating a Functional Component

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}
```

- This is a **function** that returns **JSX**.
    
- Component names **must start with an uppercase letter**.
    
- You can now **use it like a custom HTML tag**:

```jsx
<Welcome />
```

---

### 🧱 Organizing Components

You typically create each component in its **own file**:

📁 `src/components/Welcome.js`

```jsx
export default function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>;
}
```

📁 `src/App.js`

```jsx
import Welcome from "./components/Welcome";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 📦 Props – Passing Data to Components

> **Props** (short for “properties”) are like **function parameters**. They let you **pass data** into components.

```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

Using the component:

```jsx
<Greeting name="Alice" />
<Greeting name="Bob" />
```

You can pass **any data type**: strings, numbers, arrays, even functions.

---

### 🔄 Components Can Call Other Components

This is called **composition**, and it’s how you build large UIs:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <MainContent />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 🧠 Summary Notes

> - Components are **JavaScript functions** that return JSX.
>     
> - They must start with a **capital letter**.
>     
> - Components can be **reused** across the app.
>     
> - You use **props** to pass data into components.
>     
> - You **compose** components together to build UIs.

### ✅ Key Syntax Recap

```jsx
function Hello(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

<Hello name="John" />
```

## 🧪 Practice Questions (Step 4)

1. What is a component in React, and why are they useful?
    - Components are reusable html elements, in react, they work as a building block for any react application.
2. What’s the difference between functional and class components?
    - functional are modern.
3. Write a functional component named `Welcome` that returns a heading with the text “Welcome User”.
    - `export default function Welcome(){ return (<h1> Welcome </h1>); }`
4. How do you pass props to a component? Show with code.
    - `export default function Page(props) {} | <Page name = "Arbash"/>`
5. What happens if you don’t use a capital letter when naming a component?
	- `Error`
