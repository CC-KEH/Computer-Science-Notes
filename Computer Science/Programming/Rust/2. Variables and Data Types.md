# Rust Programming: **Variables, Mutability, and Data Types**
---

### 🎯 Goal of Step 2:

- Understand **variables** and **bindings** in Rust
- Learn about **immutability** and how to make variables mutable
- Grasp Rust’s **data types** (scalars & compounds)
- Learn how **type inference** works

---

## 📦 2.1 Variables and `let` Bindings

In Rust, variables are declared using the `let` keyword:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

> 🧠 `let` creates a **binding** — a name attached to a value.

### ⚠️ Immutability by Default

Rust variables are **immutable** by default. That means:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    x = 6; // ❌ ERROR!
}
```

> ❗ This will give a compile-time error: “cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`”

---

### ✅ Making a Variable Mutable

Use `mut` if you want the variable to be **mutable**:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("Before: {}", x);
    x = 6;
    println!("After: {}", x);
}
```

> 🛡️ This immutability-by-default is a **safety feature** that helps prevent bugs.

## 🧮 2.2 Scalar Data Types

Rust has **4 primary scalar types** (single value):

|Type|Example|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`i32`|`let x: i32 = 42;`|Signed integer (default)|
|`f64`|`let y: f64 = 3.14;`|Floating-point (default)|
|`bool`|`let b = true;`|Boolean (true/false)|
|`char`|`let c = 'A';`|Unicode scalar values|

### 🧠 Examples:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a: i32 = -10;
    let b: u32 = 20;       // unsigned integer
    let pi: f64 = 3.14159;
    let is_rust_fun = true;
    let letter = '🦀';
    
    println!("a: {}, b: {}, pi: {}, bool: {}, char: {}", a, b, pi, is_rust_fun, letter);
}
```

---

## 🧳 2.3 Compound Types

### ✅ Tuple

Fixed-size, **heterogeneous** collection.

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, char) = (500, 6.4, 'R');
    let (x, y, z) = tup;
    println!("x: {}, y: {}, z: {}", x, y, z);
    
    println!("Access directly: {}", tup.1); // 6.4
}
```

### ✅ Array

Fixed-size, **homogeneous** collection:

```rust
fn main() {
    let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    println!("First: {}", arr[0]);
}
```

---

## 🧠 2.4 Type Inference

Rust is statically typed, but you don’t always need to write the type.

```rust
fn main() {
    let score = 95;       // inferred as i32
    let temp = 36.6;      // inferred as f64
}
```

> Rust figures it out at compile time — unless it's ambiguous.

## 📌 Summary

|Concept|Example|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|`let`|`let x = 10;`|Immutable by default|
|`let mut`|`let mut x = 10;`|Allows variable to be changed|
|Scalar types|`i32`, `f64`, `bool`, `char`|Single values|
|Tuple|`(i32, f64, char)`|Mixed types, fixed-size|
|Array|`[i32; 5]`|Same type, fixed-size|
|Type inference|`let name = "Rust";`|Type deduced at compile-time|

## 🧪 Practice Exercises

### 🧠 Exercise 1:

Create a mutable variable `age`, set it to `25`, then change it to `26`. Print both values.

#### Answer 1:

```rust
fn main(){
	let mut age: u32 = 25;
	println!("{}", age);
	age = 26;
	println!("{}", age);
}
```

---

### 🧠 Exercise 2:

Create a tuple `(3, false, 'Z')`. Destructure it into three variables and print each one.

```rust
fn main(){
	let tup1: (i32, bool, char) = (3, false, 'Z');
	let (x, y, z) = tup1
	println("x: {}, y: {}, z: {}", x,y,z)
}
```

---

### 🧠 Exercise 3:

Create an array of 5 floating-point numbers. Print the 3rd element.

```rust
fn main(){
	let arr: [f32; 5] = [2.241, 0.41, 3.241, 8.1, 5.241]
	println!("{}", arr[2])
}
```

---

### 🧠 Exercise 4:

What happens if you try to access `arr[5]` in an array of 5 elements? Try it and **write down the compiler error message.**

#### Answer

- index out of bounds: the length is 5 but the index is 5

---

### 🧠 Exercise 5 (Challenge):

Create a tuple with a `name` (string slice), an `age` (u8), and a `height` (f32). Print the tuple values using destructuring and also direct indexing.

```rust
fn main(){
	let tup1: (&str, u8, f32) = ("Arbash", 23, 5.7);
	let (name, age, height) = tup1;
	println!("Name: {}, Age: {}, Height: {}",name, age, height);
}
```
