# Rust Programming: **Getting Started & Understanding `fn main()`**
---

### 🎯 Goal of Step 1:

- Set up your Rust environment
- Understand how a basic Rust program works
- Learn about `fn main()`, the `println!` macro, and compiling
- Write and run your first Rust program

---

## 📦 1.1 Setting Up Rust

To start writing and compiling Rust code, you’ll need to install the Rust toolchain.

### ✅ Install Rust (via `rustup`)

#### For Windows/macOS/Linux:

Open a terminal and run:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

This installs:

- `rustc` (the Rust compiler)
- `cargo` (Rust’s package manager and build tool)
- `rust-std` (standard library)

After installation, restart your terminal and run:

```sh
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

✅ If both commands give versions, you're set!

---

## 🧪 1.2 Your First Rust Program

### 📁 Create a new project:

```sh
cargo new hello_rust
cd hello_rust
```

This creates:

```
hello_rust/
├── Cargo.toml      # Project metadata
└── src/
    └── main.rs     # Entry point of your app
```

Open `src/main.rs`. You’ll see:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

---

## 🔍 1.3 Understanding the Code

Let’s break this down:

### ✅ `fn main()`

- `fn` stands for **function**.
- `main` is the **entry point** of any executable Rust program.
- Every Rust program must have **exactly one** `main()` function.

```rust
fn main() {
    // code goes here
}
```

### ✅ `println!("Hello, world!");`

- `println!` is a **macro** (notice the `!` at the end).
- It prints a line to the standard output with a newline.
- Macros are **metaprogramming constructs**—we’ll learn about them deeply later.

> 🧠 Think of `println!` as "print line" + newline.

---

## ⚙️ 1.4 Compiling & Running

### Use Cargo (recommended)

```sh
cargo run
```

Output:

```
Compiling hello_rust v0.1.0
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.45s
     Running `target/debug/hello_rust`
Hello, world!
```

### Or compile manually (not typical):

```sh
rustc src/main.rs
./main   # or main.exe on Windows
```

---

## 🛠 1.5 Optional: Install an IDE

Highly recommended:

- **VS Code** with the [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) extension.
- JetBrains [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) (with Rust plugin)

These will give you autocompletion, error checking, and more.

## 🧠 Summary

|Concept|What It Does|
|---|---|
|`fn main()`|Entry point of your Rust program|
|`println!()`|Macro to print to the console|
|`cargo run`|Compiles and runs your project|
|`rustc`|Compiles individual Rust files|
|`!` in `println!`|Indicates it's a macro, not a function|

## 🧪 Practice Exercises

Now let’s challenge your understanding.

#### 🧠 Exercise 1:

Write a program that prints:

```
Rust is awesome!
```

#### Answer 1:

```rust
fn main(){
	println!("Rust is awesome!");
}
```

#### 🧠 Exercise 2:

Print your name, age, and favorite programming language using three different `println!()` statements.

```rust
fn main(){
	println!("Name: Arbash");
	println!("Age: 23");
	println!("Favourite Programming Language: Python");
}
```

#### 🧠 Exercise 3:

Try to create a new project with `cargo`, and make it print:

```
Learning Rust step by step.
```

```shell
cargo init new-project
```

```rust
fn main(){
	println!("Learning Rust step by step");
}
```

#### 🧠 Exercise 4 (Challenge):

Find out what happens if you **remove** the `main()` function and try to compile your program.

- What error do you get?
- What if you change the name `main` to `start`?
- Try it and **explain the error** in your own words.

#### Answer:
 - `main` function not found in crate `main`
 - `main` function not found in crate `main`
 - Every rust program requires a starting function to execute, which is the function main.
 even if we create thousands of functions, the only way for rust to find what to execute is through the main function.
