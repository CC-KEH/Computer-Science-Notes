Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, performance, and concurrency. It aims to provide low-level control over hardware with high-level abstractions, making it suitable for building reliable and efficient software, including operating systems, web browsers, and game engines. Rust is known for its memory safety features, achieved without relying on a garbage collector.
