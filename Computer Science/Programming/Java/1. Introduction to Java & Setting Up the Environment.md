### ðŸ“Œ What is Java?

Java is a **high-level, object-oriented programming language** developed by **Sun Microsystems** (now owned by Oracle). It's known for its portability, robustness, and security features.

**Key Features:**

- **Platform Independent**: "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) via the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
    
- **Object-Oriented**: Everything revolves around objects and classes.
    
- **Robust and Secure**: Exception handling, memory management, and built-in security.
    
- **Multithreaded**: Java supports multithreaded programming.
    
- **Rich API and Large Community**: Huge set of libraries and frameworks.

### ðŸ§  How Java Works

1. **Source Code (`.java`)**
    
2. Compiled by **javac** â†’ **Bytecode (`.class`)**
    
3. **JVM** executes the bytecode on any platform.

```plaintext
Your Code (.java) â†’ Compiler â†’ Bytecode (.class) â†’ JVM â†’ Output

### ðŸ”§ Setting Up Java Environment

1. **Install JDK (Java Development Kit)**:
    
    - Go to: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
        
    - Download and install the latest **JDK** for your OS.
        
2. **Set Environment Variables (For Windows)**:
    
    - Add JDKâ€™s `bin` path to your system's **PATH** variable.
        
    - Example: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21\bin`
        
3. **Install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**:
    
    - Beginners: [BlueJ](https://www.bluej.org/) or [JGrasp](https://jgrasp.org/)
        
    - Standard: [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)
        
    - Lightweight: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Java extensions.

### âœ… Your First Java Program

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

#### ðŸ’¡ Breakdown:

- `public class HelloWorld`: Declares a class.
    
- `public static void main(String[] args)`: Entry point of the program.
    
- `System.out.println(...)`: Prints text to the console.

### ðŸ”„ Compile & Run

#### **Command Line**:

1. Save as `HelloWorld.java`
    
2. Open terminal and navigate to the file.
    
3. Compile:
    
    ```
    javac HelloWorld.java
    ```
    
4. Run:
    
    ```
    java HelloWorld
    ```

## ðŸ§ª Quiz â€“ Step 1 Review Questions

1. What does JVM stand for, and what does it do?
    - Java Virtual Machine, It executes the byte code on different os.
2. What is the difference between source code and bytecode in Java?
    - source code is human readable, where as bytecode is intermediate, platform independent representation of the code.
3. Explain the phrase "Write Once, Run Anywhere".
    - To be able to run a java application, anywhere once it is compiled to bytecode.
4. What is the role of `public static void main(String[] args)` in a Java program?
    - declaration of main function, which will be called first, once the program executes.
5. How do you compile and run a Java file from the command line?
	- `javac hello.java` `java hello`
