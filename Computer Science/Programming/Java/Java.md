Java is a widely used, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language and computing platform. It was first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Java is known for its "write once, run anywhere" capability due to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allows Java code to run on various operating systems without modification.
