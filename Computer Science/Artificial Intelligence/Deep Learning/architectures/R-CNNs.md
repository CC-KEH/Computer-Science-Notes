## R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network)

R-CNN is a pioneering object detection architecture that introduced the concept of region proposals. Here are key points:

- **Pipeline:**
  - Regions are proposed using a selective search algorithm.
  - These proposed regions are then individually classified using a CNN.

- **Training Process:**
  - The model is trained in a multi-stage process: pre-training the CNN on ImageNet, fine-tuning on object proposals, and fine-tuning again for object classification.

- **Drawbacks:**
  - Computationally expensive due to processing each region independently.
  - Slow inference speed, limiting real-time applications.

## Fast R-CNN

Fast R-CNN addressed the speed and efficiency issues of R-CNN. Here's an overview:

- **Pipeline:**
  - Instead of processing each region independently, Fast R-CNN introduced the Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer, allowing the network to directly extract features from the regions proposed by selective search.

- **Training Process:**
  - Single-stage training, jointly optimizing region proposal, classification, and bounding box regression.

- **Advantages:**
  - Faster training and testing compared to R-CNN.
  - Shared computation for overlapping regions.

- **Drawbacks:**
  - Still computationally intensive during training due to the need for RoI pooling.

## Faster R-CNN

Faster R-CNN builds upon Fast R-CNN, introducing a region proposal network (RPN) to enhance speed and efficiency:

- **Pipeline:**
  - The RPN generates region proposals directly from the feature maps, sharing the same convolutional layers with the object detection network.

- **Training Process:**
  - End-to-end training, jointly optimizing the RPN and the Fast R-CNN.

- **Advantages:**
  - Improved speed compared to its predecessors.
  - Unified, end-to-end training for both region proposal and object detection.

- **Contributions:**
  - Introduced anchor boxes to handle various object scales and aspect ratios efficiently.
