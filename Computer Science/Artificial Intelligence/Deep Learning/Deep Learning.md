## Introduction

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data. Neural networks are inspired by the human brain, and they are able to learn complex patterns and relationships in data. Deep learning has been used to achieve state-of-the-art results in many different tasks, including image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
