## Core Objectives of Computer Vision

1. **Image Recognition:**
   - Identifying and classifying objects within images.
   - Common applications include facial recognition, object detection, and image categorization.

2. **Image Segmentation:**
   - Dividing an image into meaningful segments to analyze and understand its structure.
   - Used in medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, and scene understanding.

3. **Object Tracking:**
   - Continuously following and monitoring the movement of objects in video sequences.
   - Essential for surveillance, robotics, and sports analysis.

4. **Scene Reconstruction:**
   - Building three-dimensional models of scenes from two-dimensional images.
   - Applied in virtual reality, augmented reality, and architectural design.

5. **Gesture Recognition:**
   - Understanding and interpreting human gestures from visual data.
   - Used in human-computer interaction, sign language recognition, and gaming.

6. **Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping):**
   - Simultaneously determining a device's location and mapping its surroundings using visual data.
   - Crucial for robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous navigation.
