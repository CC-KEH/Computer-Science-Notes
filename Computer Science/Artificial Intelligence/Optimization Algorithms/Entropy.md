# Definition
The concept of entropy is commonly used in machine learning, especially in decision tree algorithms, to measure the impurity or disorder in a dataset. Different values of entropy convey information about the homogeneity or heterogeneity of the dataset with respect to class labels. Here's what different values of entropy generally signify:

1. **Entropy = 0:**
   - **Interpretation:** A value of 0 entropy indicates perfect purity, meaning all the samples in the dataset belong to a single class.
   - **Implication:** The dataset is perfectly homogeneous, making it very easy to make predictions. There is no uncertainty about the class labels.

2. **0 < Entropy < 1:**
   - **Interpretation:** Entropy between 0 and 1 indicates partial impurity. There is a mixture of classes in the dataset, but one or a few classes may dominate.
   - **Implication:** The dataset is somewhat heterogeneous, and predictions may be less certain compared to a dataset with entropy equal to 0.

3. **Entropy = 1:**
   - **Interpretation:** A value of 1 entropy signifies maximum impurity. Classes are evenly distributed in the dataset.
   - **Implication:** The dataset is highly heterogeneous, and making accurate predictions based solely on the information in the dataset is challenging. More complex models or additional features may be needed.

4. **Entropy > 1:**
   - **Interpretation:** Entropy greater than 1 is not a standard interpretation in this context. It's generally restricted to the [0, 1] range.
   - **Implication:** It may suggest an error or an issue with the entropy calculation, as entropy is expected to be between 0 and 1.





# Cross-Entropy Loss Function

- Cross-entropy loss is used when adjusting model weights during training. The aim is to minimize the loss, i.e. the smaller the loss the better the model.
- A perfect model has a cross-entropy loss of 0.

## Hinge Loss
The function max(0,1-t) is called the hinge loss function.

It is equal to 0 when tâ‰¥1.

Its derivative is -1 if t<1 and 0 if t>1.

It is not differentiable at t=1 . but we can still use gradient
descent using any subderivative at t=1.

Hinge loss is most popular loss function during pre-deep
learning era.

Hinge loss is often used for binary classification problems.

This type of loss is primarily used in SVM classifiers where
the target values are in the set {-1, 1}.

When using hinge loss it is important to change the class
label to -1 and +1.
