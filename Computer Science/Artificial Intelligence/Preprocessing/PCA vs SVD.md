Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are closely related techniques, and SVD is actually one of the methods used to perform PCA. Here's a brief overview of both techniques and when to use them:

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
   - **Purpose:** PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional space while retaining as much variance as possible. It identifies the principal components (linear combinations of the original features) that capture the most significant information in the data.
   - **Use Cases:**
     - Dimensionality reduction when dealing with high-dimensional data.
     - Feature extraction to reduce noise and focus on the most important aspects of the data.
     - Visualization of high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space.
   - **Implementation:** PCA is commonly implemented using the covariance matrix of the data or by performing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the data matrix.

2. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):**
   - **Purpose:** SVD is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes a matrix into three other matrices, representing the singular vectors and singular values. It is a fundamental technique used in various applications, including dimensionality reduction, data compression, and solving linear systems.
   - **Use Cases:**
     - Matrix factorization for various applications, such as collaborative filtering, image compression, and data analysis.
     - Dimensionality reduction when only a subset of singular values and vectors is retained.
     - Solving linear systems of equations and pseudo-inverse calculation.
     - feature selection, visualization, noise reduction, and many more.
   - **Implementation:** SVD can be applied to various types of matrices, including rectangular matrices, and it is widely used in numerical linear algebra libraries.

**When to Use PCA vs. SVD:**
   - **PCA is a specific application of SVD:** PCA is essentially a specific application of SVD, where the SVD is performed on the covariance matrix of the data.
   - **Use PCA for Dimensionality Reduction:** If your primary goal is dimensionality reduction or feature extraction, it is common to use PCA. PCA identifies the principal components, which are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, through SVD.
   - **Use SVD for General Matrix Decomposition:** If your goal is more general, such as matrix factorization, solving linear systems, or obtaining a low-rank approximation of a matrix, SVD is a more direct tool.
