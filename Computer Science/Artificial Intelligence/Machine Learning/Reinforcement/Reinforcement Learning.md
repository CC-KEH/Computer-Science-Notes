# Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns by trial and error. The model is not given any labeled data, but it is given a reward for taking actions that lead to desired outcomes. The model learns to take actions that maximize the reward.

##### Some of the most common reinforcement learning algorithms include:

- **[[Markov decision processes]] (MDPs)** are a mathematical framework for reinforcement learning. MDPs model the environment as a set of states, actions, and rewards.
- **[[Q-learning]]** is a reinforcement learning algorithm that learns to estimate the value of taking each action in each state.
- **[[Deep reinforcement learning]]** is a type of reinforcement learning that uses neural networks to learn the value function.
