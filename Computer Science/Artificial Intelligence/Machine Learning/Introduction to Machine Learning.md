# Introduction to machine learning

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms are trained on data, and they can then use that data to make predictions or decisions.

There are many different types of machine learning algorithms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most common types of machine learning algorithms include:

- **Supervised learning:** Algorithms are trained on data that has been labeled, meaning that each data point has a known output value. Supervised learning algorithms can be used to solve a variety of problems, such as classification and regression.
- **Unsupervised learning:** Algorithms are trained on data that has not been labeled. Unsupervised learning algorithms can be used to find patterns in data, such as clustering and anomaly detection.
- **Reinforcement learning:** Algorithms are trained by trial and error. Reinforcement learning algorithms can be used to solve problems where the goal is to maximize a reward, such as playing games or controlling robots.
