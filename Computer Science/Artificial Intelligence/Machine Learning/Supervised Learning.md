# Supervised learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on data that has been labeled. This means that each data point has a known output value. The model learns to predict the output value for new data points by finding patterns in the labeled data.

#### Some of the most common supervised learning algorithms include:

- **Linear regression** is a simple supervised learning algorithm that can be used to predict a continuous output value, such as price or weight.
- **Logistic regression** is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used to predict a categorical output value, such as yes or no, spam or ham.
- **Decision trees** are a supervised learning algorithm that can be used to predict both continuous and categorical output values. Decision trees work by dividing the data into smaller and smaller groups until each group is homogeneous.
- **Support vector machines (SVMs)** are a supervised learning algorithm that can be used to predict both continuous and categorical output values. SVMs work by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data points.
