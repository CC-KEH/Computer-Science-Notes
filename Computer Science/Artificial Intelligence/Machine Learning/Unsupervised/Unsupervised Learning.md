# Unsupervised learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on data that has not been labeled. This means that the model does not know the output value for any of the data points. The model learns to find patterns in the data by itself.

##### Some of the most common unsupervised learning algorithms include:

- **K-means clustering** is an unsupervised learning algorithm that can be used to group data points together. K-means clustering works by finding the k clusters in the data that minimize the within-cluster variance.
- **Principal component analysis (PCA)** is an unsupervised learning algorithm that can be used to reduce the dimensionality of data. PCA works by finding the directions in the data that contain the most variance.
- **Anomaly detection** is an unsupervised learning algorithm that can be used to identify data points that are unusual or unexpected. Anomaly detection algorithms work by finding data points that are outside of the normal distribution.
