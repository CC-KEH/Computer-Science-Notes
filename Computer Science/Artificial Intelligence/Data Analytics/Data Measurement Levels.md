The 4 levels of measurement, also known as measurement scales, are nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. These levels are used to categorize and describe data based on their characteristics and properties.

Level of measurement, also known as scale of measurement, refers to the process of categorizing data based on the characteristics and properties of the data. It’s important in statistics because it helps determine the appropriate statistical methods and tests that can be used to analyze the data.


# Nominal Data
- A variable that takes a value among a set of mutually exclusive codes that have no logical order is known as a nominal variable.
- An example of this could be color. You could encode yellow as 1 and blue as 2, but these numbers would have no specific value nor meaning. And such an encoding would not automatically make green equal to 1.5.
- In this level of measurement, words, letters, and alpha-numeric symbols can be used.

## Binary scale
- A nominal variable with exactly two mutually exclusive categories that have no logical order is known as binary variable
- A Binary variable is a special case of a nominal variable that takes only two possible values.

### Symmetric and Asymmetric Binary Scale
- Different binary variables may have unequal importance.
- If two choices of a binary variable have equal importance, then it is called symmetric binary variable.
- If the two choices of a binary variable have unequal importance, it is called asymmetric binary variable.



# Ordinal Data
- As the name suggests, ordinal data have some order. The second level of measurement is the ordinal level of measurement. Example: Shirt size = { S, M, L, XL, XXL}
- It allows you to rank the values, such as for education level: elementary is less than high_school, which in turn is less than university.
- The values assumed by an ordinal variable can beordered among themselves as each pair of values can be compared literally or using relational operators ( < , ≤ , > , ≥ ).

# Interval Data
- Interval data builds on top ordinal data.
- The third level of measurement is the interval level of measurement. The interval level of measurement not only classifies and orders the measurements, but it also specifies that the distances between each interval on the scale are equivalent along the scale from low interval to high interval. However, there is no true zero point.
- A common example is temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit. A temperature of 0°C or 0°F doesn't indicate the complete absence of temperature; it's just a point on the scale. The difference between 20°C and 30°C is the same as the difference between 30°C and 40°C.


# Ratio Data
- In the ratio level of measurement, there is a meaningful order, consistent intervals, and a true zero point.
- The presence of a true zero means that a value of zero represents the complete absence of the quantity being measured.
- A classic example is height. A height of 0 cm or 0 inches would represent the absence of height (i.e., a complete lack of height). The ratio between two heights is meaningful, and it makes sense to say that one height is twice or three times another.
- other examples are price, length, weight, amount of something, or temperature measured in Kelvin.



# Quantitative (Numerical) vs Qualitative (Categorical)
