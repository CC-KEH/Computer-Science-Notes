   - Handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzing and visualizing data to understand its characteristics, distribution, and relationships.
   - Techniques include summary statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis.

4. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Applying statistical methods to interpret data, test hypotheses, and make predictions.
   - Techniques include hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and time series analysis.

5. **Machine Learning:**
   - Utilizing algorithms and models to automate data analysis tasks, make predictions, and uncover hidden patterns.
   - Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are common approaches.

6. **Data Visualization:**
   - Presenting data and analysis results visually through charts, graphs, dashboards, and interactive visualizations.
   - Enhances understanding and communication of insights to stakeholders.

### Techniques:

1. **Descriptive Analytics:**
   - Summarizing historical data to describe past trends and events.
   - Helps in understanding what happened and why.
