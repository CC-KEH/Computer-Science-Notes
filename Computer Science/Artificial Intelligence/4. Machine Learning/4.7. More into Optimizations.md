## **Hyperparameter Tuning**

#### **What are Hyperparameters?**

- Parameters set before training that control the behavior of the model (e.g., learning rate, max depth of trees, no of neighbors).

#### Grid Search

- A systematic approach to test all possible combinations of predefined hyperparameter values.
- **Pros:** Comprehensive search.
- **Cons:** Computationally expensive for large search spaces.

#### Random Search

- Randomly selects hyperparameter combinations within specified ranges.
- **Pros:** Faster than Grid Search, especially for large parameter spaces.
- **Cons:** May miss the best combination.

## **Ensemble Methods**

#### **Random Forest**

#### What is Random Forest?

- An ensemble learning method based on the **Bagging** (Bootstrap Aggregation) technique.
- Combines predictions from multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

#### Key Features:

- **Bootstrapping:** Random sampling with replacement to create subsets of data for training individual trees.
- **Feature Randomization:** Each tree splits only on a random subset of features, enhancing diversity.

#### Advantages of Random Forest:
 
- Handles overfitting better than single decision trees.
- Robust to noise and works well on high-dimensional data.
- Provides feature importance scores.

#### **Gradient Boosting**

#### Bagging vs. Boosting

Before diving into Gradient Boosting, let's understand the two key ensemble learning techniques:

##### **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):**


- Trains multiple models independently on different random subsets of the data.
- Reduces variance and prevents overfitting by averaging (regression) or voting (classification).
- Example: **Random Forest**, which builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs.
 
##### **Boosting:**

- Trains models sequentially, where each new model focuses on correcting the errors of the previous ones.
- Reduces bias and improves accuracy by giving more weight to misclassified points.
- Example: **Gradient Boosting**, where each new model minimizes a loss function to improve predictions.

#### How Gradient Boosting Works

1. Starts with a weak learner, typically a shallow decision tree.
2. Computes residual errors (differences between actual and predicted values).
3. Trains the next model to predict these residuals, improving step by step.
4. Combines all models to make a final prediction.

#### Advantages of Gradient Boosting

- **High Accuracy:** Works well for both classification and regression. 
- **Captures Complex Patterns:** Learns from mistakes and refines predictions.

#### Challenges of Gradient Boosting

- **Prone to Overfitting:** Needs proper tuning (learning rate, tree depth, regularization).  
- **Computationally Expensive:** Training takes longer for large datasets.

#### Popular Implementations

- **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting):** Fast, regularized, and optimized for performance.
- **LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine):** More efficient for large datasets, faster training.

# **Summary**

Hyperparameter tuning involves adjusting pre-set parameters like learning rate and tree depth before training a model. Methods like Grid Search test all possible combinations, but are computationally expensive, while Random Search offers a faster alternative but may miss the best combination. Ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting improve model performance. Random Forest uses bagging (random sampling) to build diverse decision trees, while Gradient Boosting sequentially corrects model errors for better accuracy. Both methods help reduce overfitting and improve prediction accuracy, with Gradient Boosting being prone to overfitting without proper tuning.
