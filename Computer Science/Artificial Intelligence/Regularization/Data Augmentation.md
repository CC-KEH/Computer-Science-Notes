- The simplest way to reduce overfitting is to increase the size of the training data. In machine learning, we were not able to increase the size of training data as the labeled data was too costly.

- But, now let’s consider we are dealing with images. In this case, there are a few ways of increasing the size of the training data – rotating the image, flipping, scaling, shifting, etc. In the below image, some transformation has been done on the handwritten digits dataset.

- This usually provides a big leap in improving the accuracy of the model. It can be considered as a mandatory trick in order to improve our predictions.
