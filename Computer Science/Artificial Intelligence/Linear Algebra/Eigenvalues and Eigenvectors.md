#### Definition:
- **Eigenvalue:** For a square matrix \(A\), a scalar \(\lambda\) is an eigenvalue if there exists a non-zero vector \(\mathbf{v}\) such that \(A\mathbf{v} = \lambda\mathbf{v}\).  Eigen values give you the factors by which this compression/stretching occurs.
- **Eigenvector:** The vector \(\mathbf{v}\) corresponding to the eigenvalue \(\lambda\) is an eigenvector. Eigenvectors make understanding linear transformations easy. They are the "axes" (directions) along which linear transformation acts simply by "stretching/compressing" and/or "flipping";

#### Mathematical Representation:
- If \(A\) is a square matrix, \(\lambda\) is an eigenvalue of \(A\) if and only if \(\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = 0\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix.
- The equation \(A\mathbf{v} = \lambda\mathbf{v}\) can be written as \((A - \lambda I)\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}\).

#### Properties:
- Eigenvalues can be real or complex.
- Eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent.
- The sum of the eigenvalues is equal to the trace of the matrix, and the product is equal to the determinant.

### Why Use Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors?
1. **Diagonalization:**
   - Diagonalization of a matrix \(A\) involves finding a matrix \(P\) such that \(P^{-1}AP\) is a diagonal matrix. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are crucial in this process.
2. **Understanding Transformations:**
   - Eigenvalues help understand how a linear transformation scales space along its eigenvectors. Larger eigenvalues indicate greater scaling.
3. **Stability Analysis:**
   - In dynamic systems, eigenvalues are used to analyze stability. Real parts of eigenvalues indicate stability, and imaginary parts represent oscillatory behavior.
4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
   - PCA involves finding the principal components (eigenvectors) and their importance (eigenvalues). It is used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.
5. **Markov Chains:**
   - Eigenvalues are used to study long-term behavior and convergence in Markov chains.
6. **Solving Differential Equations:**
   - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors play a crucial role in solving systems of linear differential equations.

   - In machine learning, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental to techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is used for dimensionality reduction.
2. **Graph-Based Methods:**
   - In natural language processing, graph-based algorithms use eigenvalues and eigenvectors for tasks like community detection, ranking, and clustering.
3. **Recommendation Systems:**
   - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are used in collaborative filtering techniques for recommendation systems.
4. **Image Processing:**
   - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are employed in image compression, facial recognition, and feature extraction in computer vision applications.
5. **Spectral Clustering:**
   - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are utilized in spectral clustering algorithms for partitioning data.
6. **Neural Networks:**
