Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with vector spaces and linear mappings between these spaces. It provides a powerful framework for expressing and solving a wide range of mathematical and scientific problems. Here are in-depth notes on key concepts in linear algebra:

### Vectors and Vector Spaces:
1. **Vector:**
   - A vector is an ordered list of numbers. In a geometric sense, it represents a point in space or a displacement from the origin.
   - A vector in n-dimensional space is denoted as \(\mathbf{v} = [v_1, v_2, ..., v_n]\).
2. **Vector Operations:**
   - **Addition:** \(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = [u_1 + v_1, u_2 + v_2, ..., u_n + v_n]\)
   - **Scalar Multiplication:** \(c \cdot \mathbf{v} = [c \cdot v_1, c \cdot v_2, ..., c \cdot v_n]\)
3. **Vector Norm:**
   - The norm (or length) of a vector \(\mathbf{v}\) is denoted as \(\lVert \mathbf{v} \rVert\) and is calculated using various methods (e.g., Euclidean norm).
4. **Dot Product:**
   - The dot product of vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) is \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + \ldots + u_nv_n\).
   - It can be used to find angles and project one vector onto another.

### Matrices:
1. **Matrix Representation:**
   - A matrix is a 2D array of numbers. It is denoted by \(A = [a_{ij}]\), where \(a_{ij}\) is the element in the i-th row and j-th column.
2. **Matrix Operations:**
   - **Addition:** \(C = A + B\), where \(c_{ij} = a_{ij} + b_{ij}\).
   - **Scalar Multiplication:** \(C = c \cdot A\), where \(c \cdot a_{ij} = c \cdot a_{ij}\).
   - **Matrix Multiplication:** \(C = AB\), where \(c_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{ik}b_{kj}\).
3. **Identity Matrix:**
   - A square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. Denoted as \(I\).
4. **Transpose:**
   - The transpose of a matrix \(A\), denoted as \(A^T\), is obtained by swapping its rows and columns.

### Linear Transformations:
1. **Linear Transformations:**
   - A function \(T: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m\) is linear if \(T(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = T(\mathbf{u}) + T(\mathbf{v})\) and \(T(c\mathbf{u}) = cT(\mathbf{u})\).
2. **Kernel and Image (Range):**
   - The kernel of a linear transformation is the set of vectors that map to the zero vector.
   - The image (or range) is the set of all possible outputs of the transformation.

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:
1. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:**
   - For a square matrix \(A\), a scalar \(\lambda\) is an eigenvalue if there exists a non-zero vector \(\mathbf{v}\) such that \(A\mathbf{v} = \lambda\mathbf{v}\).
2. **Diagonalization:**
   - If a matrix \(A\) has \(n\) linearly independent eigenvectors, it can be diagonalized as \(A = PDP^{-1}\), where \(P\) is the matrix of eigenvectors and \(D\) is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues on the main diagonal.

### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):
1. **Singular Value Decomposition:**
   - For any matrix \(A\), there exists a factorization \(A = U \Sigma V^T\), where \(U\) and \(V\) are orthogonal matrices, and \(\Sigma\) is a diagonal matrix with singular values.
2. **Applications of SVD:**
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA), image compression, solving linear systems, and pseudoinverse calculation.

### Linear Algebra in Applications:
1. **Least Squares Method:**
   - Used for finding the best-fit line or plane in the presence of noise.
2. **Markov Chains:**
   - Linear algebra is used to study the long-term behavior of systems evolving in discrete time.
3. **Graph Theory:**
   - Matrices are used to represent and analyze graphs, with applications in network analysis and optimization.
4. **Computer Graphics and Computer Vision:**
   - Transformation matrices are used to manipulate and project 3D objects.
5. **Machine Learning:**
   - Linear algebra is fundamental in machine learning, particularly in the formulation and optimization of algorithms.
