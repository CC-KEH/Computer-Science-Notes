Triadic closure is a fundamental concept in social network analysis that refers to the tendency for individuals within a social network to form new connections based on existing connections. It is a mechanism that contributes to the growth and structure of social networks.

When two individuals in a social network have a common connection (a friend, colleague, etc.), there is an increased likelihood that they will form a new connection between themselves. This phenomenon is known as triadic closure because it completes a triangle or triad within the network.

Triadic closure has several important implications:

1. **Social Cohesion:** Triadic closure contributes to the overall connectedness and cohesion of a social network. It reinforces the social fabric by strengthening ties between individuals who share mutual connections.
    
2. **Transitivity:** Transitivity is a property of networks where if A is connected to B and B is connected to C, then there's a high likelihood that A will also be connected to C. Triadic closure is a key driver of transitivity in social networks.
    
3. **Balance Theory:** Triadic closure can also contribute to balance theory, where people tend to be more comfortable when their social connections are mutually connected. Triads with unbalanced connections (one person is not connected to another within a mutual triad) may lead to social tension and efforts to close the triangle.
    
4. **Network Evolution:** Triadic closure is a mechanism that contributes to the evolution and growth of social networks over time. As individuals form new connections, the network structure becomes more complex and interconnected.
    
5. **Information Diffusion:** Triadic closure can facilitate the spread of information within a network. When a person forms a new connection due to triadic closure, they may also gain access to new information and perspectives.
