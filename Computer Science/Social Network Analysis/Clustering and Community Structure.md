Focuses on understanding patterns of connections and relationships in social networks. Examines how nodes (individuals) cluster and form communities within networks.

## Clustering
Clustering refers to the identification of groups or clusters of nodes (individuals) in a social network that share similar characteristics or have strong connections with each other. Clusters can represent subgroups of users who interact more frequently within their group than with users in other groups.

### **Clustering Coefficient**
The clustering coefficient is a metric used to quantify the degree to which nodes in a social network tend to cluster together. In other words, it measures the extent to which a node's neighbors are also connected to each other. The clustering coefficient provides insights into the local connectivity patterns within a network and helps in understanding how "close-knit" a neighborhood of nodes is.

#### **Local Clustering Coefficient** 
There are two types of clustering coefficients: local and global. The local clustering coefficient of a node measures the proportion of its neighbors that are connected to each other, divided by the maximum possible connections between those neighbors. It helps determine how cohesive a group of nodes around a particular node is.

#### **Global Clustering Coefficient** 
The global clustering coefficient of a network measures the overall tendency of nodes in the network to form triangles. It's calculated by taking the average of the local clustering coefficients of all nodes in the network. The global clustering coefficient gives an idea of the network's overall connectedness and the prevalence of clustering in the entire network.

**Interpretation:**
- A high local clustering coefficient for a node indicates that its neighbors are well connected to each other, forming a tightly knit community.
- A high global clustering coefficient suggests that the network as a whole has many triangles, indicating a strong tendency for nodes to form clusters or communities.
- A low clustering coefficient might indicate that the network has a more dispersed or random structure, with fewer tightly interconnected clusters.

**Applications:** The clustering coefficient is used in social network analysis to understand the social cohesion and community structure within networks. It's particularly useful for identifying groups of individuals who interact frequently with each other, indicating potential communities or cliques.

**Limitations:** While the clustering coefficient is a valuable metric, it may not capture all aspects of network structure, especially in networks with varying degrees of clustering. Additionally, it's important to consider that real-world networks can exhibit a mix of high clustering and more random connections.
## Community Detection 
Community detection goes beyond simple clustering and aims to identify meaningful communities within a social network. A community is a subset of nodes that are densely connected within the subset and have sparse connections outside it. Communities often correspond to groups of individuals who share common interests, affiliations, or interactions.
