The power law distribution, also known as a Pareto distribution, is a statistical pattern where a small number of items or events have significantly higher occurrences than the majority of items or events. In other words, it follows the principle of "the rich get richer." This distribution is often observed in various natural, social, and economic systems.

Key characteristics of a power law distribution include:

1. **Heavy-Tailed Distribution:** The distribution has a heavy tail, meaning that there are a few extreme values that occur much more frequently than expected based on a normal or exponential distribution.
    
2. **Long Tail:** The tail of the distribution extends far beyond what would be expected in a more evenly distributed dataset.
    
3. **Scale-Free Property:** The distribution doesn't have a characteristic scale. In other words, there isn't a single value that defines the distribution's center or scale, making it different from Gaussian (normal) distributions.
    
4. **Zipf's Law:** The power law distribution is closely related to Zipf's law, which states that the frequency of any word in a large corpus of text is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table.
    
5. **Mathematical Form:** The probability density function (PDF) of a power law distribution is given by `P(X) ∝ X^(-α)`, where `X` is the variable, and `α` is the distribution's exponent. The exponent determines the shape of the distribution and affects how quickly the probabilities decrease as `X` increases.
    
6. **Examples:** Power law distributions are found in various fields, including social networks (e.g., the distribution of friends/followers), income distribution, city sizes, wealth distribution, the frequency of words in texts, and more.
