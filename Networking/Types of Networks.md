### Local Area Network (LAN):
   - A LAN is a network that covers a limited geographical area, such as a home, office, or school.
   - It connects devices within the same physical location and allows for high-speed data transfer.
   - LANs are commonly used for file sharing, printing, and accessing local resources.

### Wide Area Network (WAN):
   - A WAN is a network that spans a large geographical area, connecting multiple LANs and remote locations.
   - WANs often rely on public or private communication links, such as leased lines, satellite links, or internet connections.
   - The internet itself is an example of a global WAN that connects networks worldwide.

### Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):
   - A MAN covers a city or a metropolitan area, providing connectivity for organizations and institutions in the region.
   - MANs are designed to support larger networks than LANs but are smaller in scale compared to WANs.
   - Fiber-optic cables and wireless technologies are commonly used to establish MANs.

### Campus Area Network (CAN):
   - A CAN is a network that spans a university campus or a large corporate campus.
   - CANs provide connectivity between multiple buildings or departments within the campus.
   - They are typically designed to meet the specific needs of the institution or organization.

### Personal Area Network (PAN):
   - A PAN is a network that connects devices for personal use within a short range, typically within a person's workspace.
   - Bluetooth and infrared connections are common examples of PAN technologies.

### Storage Area Network (SAN):
   - A SAN is a specialized network that provides high-speed access to storage devices like disk arrays and tape libraries.
   - It enables centralized storage management and data sharing among multiple servers.

### Virtual Private Network (VPN):
   - A VPN is a secure network that uses public infrastructure, such as the internet, to create private connections between remote users or networks.
   - VPNs are often used to establish secure connections for remote workers and branch offices.

### Wireless Local Area Network (Wi-Fi):
   - Wi-Fi is a type of LAN that allows devices to connect wirelessly to a network using radio waves.
   - It enables convenient internet access and data sharing within a limited area.

### Home Area Network (HAN):
   - A HAN is a network that connects devices within a home, enabling smart home automation and connectivity.
